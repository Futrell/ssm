# TSL function
    projection function
todo: make a separate file to run the model with the processed data

1. write a loop to go through all the files in the data folder; mlregtest
2. run the code on realistic corpora
3. pTSL implementation


Plan:
MLRegTest
Even language with similar properties, entropy

Venue: Language--some linguistics venues


June - July: Contact RAs, debug code, and run simulations
July - August: Grant submission (NSF), write the paper 
August - Sept:  write the paper
